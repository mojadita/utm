Universal Transverse Mercator routines.  These routines
use FFT to model the functions and allow to calculate
efficiently with precalculated coefficients for a
determinate ellipsoid.  Direct and inverse functions
are in the library.  Several groups of coefficients are
determined for several ellipsoids.
